Developed a Python script to automate the generation of balance reminder emails for apartment tenants. The script reads tenant information from '.apt' files in a specified directory, calculates the balance, and creates a personalized email using a template file. The generated emails are saved as '.mail' files in an output directory. The script ensures unique filenames for each email and supports the use of a custom date format. Demonstrated proficiency in file I/O, regular expressions, and automation in Python.
